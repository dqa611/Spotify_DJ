# Spotify_Playlist_Mixed_created_by_Python
This project will help you create a track mix based on your Spotify Playlist. Run Spotify API to collect a playlist's data, then select the track and duration of the mix. 

The alogirthm creates a mix based on the Camelot harmonic mixing rule as well as similarity between previous and next track (tempo, danceability, valence and energy, all of which are populated from Spotify API). 

Check out my Spotify account (anhquocduong611) and look for playlist mixed by Python script :) For better effect, enable crossfade mode and don't shuffle.

Future development: I might want to mix the track by modifying the track playback, but currently Spotify is not allowing.
